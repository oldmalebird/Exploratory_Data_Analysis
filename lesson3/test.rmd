Explore the largest peak in the price histogram you created earlier.

Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width, and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
ggsave() will save the last plot created.
For example...
                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex), pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500)
