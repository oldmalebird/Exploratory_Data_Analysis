  Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.

  In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.
  The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
  (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality 
  between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model
  these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the
  best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),
  etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity
  analysis procedure).
 
4. Relevant Information:

   The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
   For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
   Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables 
   are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.
   The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than
   excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent
   or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So
   it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. 

5. Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. 

6. Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute
  
   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of
   feature selection.

7. Attribute information:

   For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

   Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
   3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)
   4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)
   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   8 - density (g / cm^3)
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
   11 - alcohol (% by volume)
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

8. Missing Attribute Values: None

9. Description of attributes:

   1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

   2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

   3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

   4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

   5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

   6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

   7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

   8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

   9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

   10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

   11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

   1 - 不挥发酸度：大多数与葡萄酒有关的酸或固定或非挥发性的酸（不易蒸发）

???2 - 挥发性酸度：葡萄酒中醋酸的含量过高会导致令人不快的醋味

???3 - 柠檬酸：少量发现，柠檬酸可以为葡萄酒增添“新鲜感”和风味

???4 - 残糖：发酵停止后剩余的糖量，很少能找到低于1克/升的葡萄酒，超过45克/升的葡萄酒被认为是甜的

???5 - 氯化物：葡萄酒中的盐量

???6 - 游离二氧化硫：游离形式的二氧化硫在分子SO2（作为溶解气体）和亚硫酸氢根离子之间存在平衡;它可以防止微生物生长和葡萄酒的氧化

???7-总二氧化硫：游离和结合形式的SO 2的量;在低浓度下，SO2在葡萄酒中几乎检测不到，但在游离SO2浓度超过50ppm时，SO2在葡萄酒的味道和味道中变得明显

???8 - 密度：根据酒精和糖含量的百分比，水的密度接近水的密度

???9 - pH：描述葡萄酒的酸度或碱度如何从0（非常酸性）到14（非常碱性）;大多数葡萄酒的pH值在3-4之间

???10 - 硫酸盐：一种葡萄酒添加剂，可以产生二氧化硫气体（SO2）水平，起到抗菌和抗氧化剂的作用

???11 - 酒精：酒的酒精含量百分比

???输出变量（基于传感数据）：
???12 - 质量（0到10之间的分数）

柠檬酸有很多0值

由上图可看出酒精度、硫酸盐含量、挥发性酸、柠檬酸、总二氧化硫与红葡萄酒质量有相关性。

挥发性有机酸含量越低，红葡萄酒的品质越高。
柠檬酸含量越高，红葡萄酒的品质越高。
酒精度越高，红葡萄酒的质量越高。
